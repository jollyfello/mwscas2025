# Biosensor Patent Analysis - MWSCAS 2025

## Overview

This project analyzes **biosensor patents** using data from the [PatentsView API](https://www.patentsview.org/). The notebook automates the process of **querying, categorizing, and visualizing** biosensor-related patents.

## Features

- **Patent Data Retrieval**: Queries the PatentsView API to fetch relevant biosensor patents.
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and structures the dataset for further analysis.
- **Categorization**: Classifies patents into specific biosensor-related categories.
- **Visualization**:
  - Stacked bar chart: Patents per year by category.
  - Bubble chart: Patent trends across different technologies.
  - Other exploratory data insights.
